Welcome to SwatchBox!

This site is made with a paper supplier in mind. I chose to focus here on color, and therefore perhaps this is currently better suited to a smaller stationary company. 

The problem this site solves comes in when a customer wants to view a sample book of swatches. Each company has their own, and therefore you may need to purchase or put a deposit on multiple books in order to view as many colors. The price of losing one of these books can be steep. This site allows customers to design their own custom books, for a nominal fee.

Further iterations of the project would allow for weight and thickness selectors, as well as finish. Also, similar suggestions would be filled in with seed data.
